# LifePilot v1.0.1 🚀


LifePilot is a Telegram bot (and future mobile app) designed to help you track and improve your life’s key metrics:

- Physical state 💪  
- Mental state 🧠  
- Social environment 🌐  
- Goals and actions 🎯  

It checks in twice daily to ask how you’re doing, analyzes your responses using a powerful model (Qwen3), and tracks changes over time. You can chat with LifePilot naturally — via text or voice messages (with Whisper API support) — and receive thoughtful insights tailored to your well-being.
